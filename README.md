# component

'Component' is a tiny Clojure framework for managing the lifecycle of
software components with runtime state which must be manually
initialized and destroyed.

This is primarily a design pattern with a few helper functions.

## Introduction

For the purposes of this framework, a *component* is a collection of
functions or procedures which share some runtime state.

Some examples of components:

* Database access: query and insert functions sharing a database
  connection

* External API service: functions to send and retrieve data sharing an
  HTTP connection pool

* Web server: functions to handle different routes sharing all the
  runtime state of the web application, such as a session store

* In-memory cache: functions to get and set data in a shared mutable
  reference such as a Clojure Atom or Ref

A *component* is similar in spirit to the definition of an *object* in
Object-Oriented Programming.

Clojure is not an object-oriented programming language, so we do not
have to cram everything into this model. Some functions are just
functions. But real-world applications need to manage state.
Components are a tool to help with that.
