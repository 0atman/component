# component

'Component' is a tiny Clojure framework for managing the lifecycle of
software components with runtime state which must be manually
initialized and destroyed.

This is primarily a design pattern with a few helper functions. It can
be seen as a style of dependency injection using immutable data
structures.

## Dependencies and Compatibility

I have successfully tested 'Component' with Clojure versions
1.4.0 and 1.5.1.

'Component' depends on my [dependency] library.

## Introduction

For the purposes of this framework, a *component* is a collection of
functions or procedures which share some runtime state.

Some examples of components:

* Database access: query and insert functions sharing a database
  connection

* External API service: functions to send and retrieve data sharing an
  HTTP connection pool

* Web server: functions to handle different routes sharing all the
  runtime state of the web application, such as a session store

* In-memory cache: functions to get and set data in a shared mutable
  reference such as a Clojure Atom or Ref

A *component* is similar in spirit to the definition of an *object* in
Object-Oriented Programming.

Clojure is not an object-oriented programming language, so we do not
have to cram everything into this model. Some (most) functions are
just functions. But real-world applications need to manage state.
Components are a tool to help with that.



## Usage

```clojure
(ns com.example.your-application
  (:require [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]))
```

### Creating Components

To define a component, define a Clojure record that implements the
`Lifecycle` protocol.

```clojure
(defrecord Database [host port connection]
  ;; Implement the Lifecycle protocol
  component/Lifecycle

  (start [component]
    (println ";; Starting database")
    ;; In the 'start' method, initialize this component
    ;; and start it running. For example, connect to a
    ;; database, create thread pools, or initialize shared
    ;; state.
    (let [conn (connect-to-database host port)]
      ;; Return an updated version of the component with
      ;; the run-time state assoc'd in.
      (assoc component :connection conn)))

  (stop [component]
    (println ";; Stopping database")
    ;; In the 'stop' method, shut down the running
    ;; component and release any external resources it has
    ;; acquired.
    (.close connection)
    ;; Return the component, optionally modified.
    component))
```

Optionally, provide a constructor function that takes in
the essential configuration parameters of the component,
leaving the runtime state blank.

```clojure
(defn new-database [host port]
  (map->Database {:host host :port port}))
```

Define the functions implementing the behavior of the
component to take the component itself as an argument.

```clojure
(defn get-user [database username]
  (execute-query (:connection database)
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
    username))

(defn add-user [database username favorite-color]
  (execute-insert (:connection database)
    "INSERT INTO users (username, favorite_color)"
    username favorite-color))
```

Define other components in terms of the components on which they
depend.

```clojure
(defrecord ExampleComponent [options cache database scheduler]
  component/Lifecycle

  (start [this]
    (println ";; Starting ExampleComponent")
    ;; In the 'start' method, a component may assume that its
    ;; dependencies are available and have already been started.
    (assoc this :admin (get-user database "admin")))

  (stop [this]
    (println ";; Stopping ExampleComponent")
    ;; Likewise, in the 'stop' method, a component may assume that its
    ;; dependencies will not be stopped until AFTER it is stopped.
    this))
```

Not all the dependencies need to be supplied at construction time.
In general, the constructor should not depend on other components
being available or started.

```clojure
(defn example-component [config-options]
  (map->ExampleComponent {:options config-options
                          :cache (atom {})}))
```


### Systems

Components are composed into systems. A system is a component which
knows how to start and stop other components.

A system can use the helper functions `start-system` and `stop-system`,
which take a set of keys naming components in the system to be
started/stopped. Order of the keys doesn't matter here.

```clojure
(def example-system-components [:scheduler :app :db])

(defrecord ExampleSystem [config-options db scheduler app]
  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (component/start-system this example-system-components))
  (stop [this]
    (component/stop-system this example-system-components)))
```

When constructing the system, specify the dependency relationships
among components with the `using` function.

```clojure
(defn example-system [config-options]
  (let [{:keys [host port]} config-options]
    (map->ExampleSystem
      {:config-options config-options
       :db (new-database host port)
       :scheduler (new-scheduler)
       :app (component/using
              (example-component config-options)
              {:database  :db
               :scheduler :scheduler})})))
;;             ^          ^
;;             |          |
;;             |          \- Keys in the ExampleSystem record
;;             |
;;             \- Keys in the ExampleComponent record
```

`using` takes a component and a map telling the system where to
find that component's dependencies. Keys in the map are the keys in
the component record itself, values are the map are the
corresponding keys in the system record.

Based on this information (stored as metadata on the component
records) the `start-system` function will construct a dependency graph
of the components and start them all in the correct order.

Before starting each componenet, `start-system` will `assoc` its
dependencies based on the metadata provided by `using`.

Optionally, if the keys in the system map are the same as in the
component map, they may be passed as a vector to `using`. If you
know all the dependencies in advance, you may even add the metadata
in the component's constructor:

```clojure
(defrecord AnotherComponent [component-a component-b])

(defrecord AnotherSystem [component-a component-b component-c])

(defn another-component []
  (component/using
    (map->AnotherComponent {})
    [:component-a :component-b]))
```

### Sample Usage

```clojure
(def system (example-system {:host "dbhost.com" :port 123}))
;;=> #'examples/system

(alter-var-root #'system component/start)
;; Starting database
;; Opening database connection
;; Starting scheduler
;; Starting ExampleComponent
;; execute-query
;;=> #examples.ExampleSystem{ ... }

(alter-var-root #'system component/stop)
;; Stopping ExampleComponent
;; Stopping scheduler
;; Stopping database
;; Closing database connection
;;=> #examples.ExampleSystem{ ... }
```


### Usage Notes

The top-level "system" record is intended to be used exclusively for
starting and stopping other components. No component in the system
should depend on its parent system.

Application functions should not receive the top-level system as an
argument. Rather, each component contains only what it needs, and
components are isolated from one another.

The "application" or "business logic" may itself be represented by a
component.

Components may, of course, implement other protocols besides
`Lifecycle`.

Different implementations of a component (for example, a stub version
for testing) can be injected into a system with `assoc` before calling
`start`.

Systems may be composed into larger systems.


### Notes for Library Authors

'Component' is intended as a tool for application developers, not
library authors. I do not believe that a general-purpose library
should impose any particular structure on the application which uses
it.

That said, libraries can make it trivially easy for application
authors to use their libraries in combination with the 'Component'
pattern by following these guidelines:

* Never create global mutable state (for example, an Atom or Ref
  stored in a `def`).

* Never rely on dynamic binding to convey state (for example, the
  "current" database connection).

* Encapsulate all the runtime state needed by the library in a single
  data structure.

* Provide functions to construct and destroy that data structure.

* Take the encapsulated runtime state as an argument to any library
  functions which depend on it.
